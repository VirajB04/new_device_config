Address configurations states the status of address. Initially it shows address status as 1 and shows option to reset….further after clicking on current address, it won’t move anywhere as it shows only status. After clicking “Address reset?” option, it will ask for confirmation with YES or NO. Further if clicked yes, screen will show Address loading… and if clicked NO, it will redirect to last page.
While loading address it is expected not to click button as it will hinder the process. If address reset is success, the screen will show Address reset success and then you can go back to screen or menu, otherwise if address reset is failure, screen will show Address reset failure and you can proceed accordingly.

Next option is feature configurations, where we can explore features like to set button only or button with proximity sensor or proximity sensor only or flap door only or Flap door with button or proximity sensor or both accordingly like how we need.
                                                     

In Proximity sensor configurations, we will find threshold length and timer to detect. We can change threshold length accordingly in terms of either 5cm or 10cm or 15cm. We can change even timer of sensor either to  3/4/5/6 seconds.
